Scientific Objectives
-------------------------------

The working group aims to address the following scientific problems:

    1) Understand the geological factors that contribute for the formation, distribution and preservation of seafloor massive sulfide deposits, including geological and tectonic setting;
    
    2) Characterize the geological, geophysical and geochemical signatures that allow for the detection and documentation of inactive and buried sulfide deposits at Mid-Ocean Ridge-axis or off-axis settings;
    
    3) Identify multi-scale observations that could be used to predict past, present and possibly future hydrothermal deposit formation;
    
    4) Determine the spatial distribution pattern and resource potential of mid ocean ridges with various spreading rates;
    
    5) Understand the timing and variations in the geological drivers for hydrothermal activity across mid-ocean ridge segment-scale systems;
    
    6) Determine the dimensional structure and metal inventory for mid-ocean spreading ridges based on long-term heat flow, volcanism, fluid fluxes and sedimentation rates;
    
    7) Understand the processes of seafloor and sub-seafloor sulfide formation, weathering, and their impact on crust-to-water column exchange in metals.
